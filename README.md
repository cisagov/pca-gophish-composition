[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/pca-gophish-composition/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/pca-gophish-composition/actions)

Creates a Docker composition containing instances of:

- [gophish](https://github.com/cisagov/docker-gophish/) phishing framework.
- [gophish-tools](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/) helper scripts.
- [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) email testing tool.
- [postfix](https://github.com/cisagov/docker-postfix/) mail server.

## Usage ##

A sample [docker composition](docker-compose.yml) is included
in this repository.

To start the composition use the command: `docker-compose up`

It's normal for the `gophish-tools` container to exit shortly after startup;
it is included in this composition as a convenience for phishing operators.
For usage details, read the
[`gophish-tools` documentation](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/).
The following `gophish-tools` helper scripts are available in the
`gophish-tools` directory:

- `import_assessment.sh`: Simplifies the process of importing an assessment
  JSON file into the GoPhish server running in the local Docker composition
  (calls
  [`gophish-tools/gophish-import`](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/blob/develop/src/tools/gophish_import.py)
  and [`gophish-tools/gophish-complete`](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/blob/develop/src/tools/gophish_complete.py)).
- `export_assessment.sh`: Simplifies the process of exporting assessment data
  from the GoPhish server running in the local Docker composition to a JSON
  file (calls
  [`gophish-tools/gophish-export`](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/blob/develop/src/tools/gophish_export.py)).
- `complete_campaign.sh`: Simplifies the process of completing a campaign
  on the GoPhish server running in the local Docker composition (calls
  [`gophish-tools/gophish-complete`](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/blob/develop/src/tools/gophish_complete.py)).
- `test_assessment.sh`: Simplifies the process of sending test emails for
  an assessment in the GoPhish server running in the local Docker
  composition (calls
  [`gophish-tools/gophish-test`](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools/blob/develop/src/tools/gophish_test.py)).

Connect to the `gophish` admin web interface at:
[https://localhost:3333](https://localhost:3333).
The default credentials are `admin`, `gophish1`.

Once the composition is running, `gophish` will need to be
configured to talk to `mailhog` and `postfix`. Create new
sending profiles for the two servers as listed below:

| Name    | Host:Port    |
| ------- | ------------ |
| MailHog | mailhog:1025 |
| Postfix | postfix:587  |

The `mailhog` email testing tool can be accessed at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**:  Do not use the sample certificates in a production environment.
They are include to simplify testing.

### Ports ###
